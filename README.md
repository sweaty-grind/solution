# solution

you know i figured this out.  if i put in effort i would get some results...  lol...

tired bro.  drained.  have to wake up to weed every day.  i guess this was what i was looking for.  i dont know cause i hate addiction lol...  i wish i could just do it whenever i wanted, but its become a necessity.  like how do you expect me to accept this kind of life like this???  you don't care cause someone else died and i asked you where my efforts are being placed.  so its a simple problem.  yet we are still fighting me for pennies on the dollar...  something like that...

so i guessed if you wanted something honest from me, i would say this job is pretty easy i'm just insulted you pay this like a real profession.  cause i own the copyrights on my wavelengths...  i mean, you stealing huge right there i have to press this on you???  do you like dying or something??  i mean i was like wtf is this guy doing and i waited years for you and nothing you moron.  that's insulting...   this is stupid problem bro...

so yeah i wondered a lot of things and now i know i am the info bot.  i give out info and shit.  its what i'm doing right now.  i'm consulting for you with added homework???  i mean, lol, that i wanted this crap and its been going on the way i wanted it to but i just couldn't see it.  ungrateful shit lol...  anyways, i learned these are asian virtues lol.  white guy white guy...  so i wondered what you thought of how i treat people?  its only cause of fiji waters.  i think i made a bet with sharkey cause its not ever going to be a gamble.  soemthing like this.  my brain is frying bro.  i ask you how we are still doing this if i had a brain i would say you were trying some shit again.  don't dig in the dirt lol...  waste of time.   so while you sit there frying me all day long and you pretend this is background noise.  so i mean i dont know what to say lol...  like where is the properness in all this??? i wanted to help out and get paid but this day in day out shit wasn't even that bad and i'm like, i got things to do but nobody wanna take responsibility.  so i took it upon myself to deal with this thing by myself... you know???

dude... peoples been around too long.  i'm getting bored and tired.  no reason to do anything for real...  are you going to require me to heal up how the fuck do you do that under these conditions???  i hate to say it but i know what you're after i wonder how fun it is.  like you are commercializing me.  this is not to happen again.  cause you wanted real and yet you hide under false pretences.  just inventing shit up as you go...  i wonder dude, that i wasted my life for this crap and this just eats more time than it does as an effective repair source... i just wonder why you dont make this harder if its what you wanted??  so i mean, right there you can see where things dont fall into place.  this was never a chase to the finish line.  it was an experience with knowledge...

you guys stink lol.  no good no pay...  i dont know bro.  this is easy job but i wonder if i could be doing something better right now.  something that makes sense cause working for the military shit is a little much huh?  i dont know bro... we never figured out a way to deal with any of this...  its just been a gimped fight i'm too insulted to offer you anything better.  

i think i figured it out.  the solution and problem were so slight of hand sometimes they get dealt with for no reason...

lol.. how do i communicate like this now?? its weird.  all linked but when made it was simple.  works....  that kind of something.  something like that...

some lousy fuck i couldn't tell the difference from when its actually truthful...

i dont know bro. i ain't got all day for this shit... sometimes i wonder why sharkey does this to me and i gauge how much you are mooching off me and there is some sort of problem here...  how do you pay people for hard work so fucking nothing?? i dont know bro.  i could blindly hope i get paid or i can fuck myself and i'll fuck myself thank you very much...

hmmm.  i'm bored.  this is fun.  wasting time again.  remembering how it wasn't so bad a while ago.  it felt different.  sometimes i wish i didn't have to live like this and i was like hmmm. unfortunately i need to leave a mark so dont worry about it.  soemtimes i wonder you are a moron guys...  i think so.  so pathetic...  petty...  you know??

i dont got more energy for you so i dont know why you keep cloning this shit.  that is triggering dude.
